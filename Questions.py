#this is gonna be the function to help answer questions when prompted. when we first get to the questions it will ask us to enter email, phome number, name this part is already filled in when you create a profile so we can skip
#then will ask us to upload a resume/ people who use linkedin already have resume on their profile


#so we can skip the contact info page and resume page and hit next
# only thing is to create answers for the rest of the questions
# best would be to answer as many questions as possible then save the application and comback later to fill it
